# Garage Door Opener Signal Dataset

This repository contains signal data and spectograph images of signals acquired from three garage door opener devices. Each signal is an On-Off Keying (OOK) signal operating at roughly 315 MHz with either two or three unique signals per device. Each signal consists of repeated phrases within each pulse with at least one "word", or unique signal block, within each phrase. This dataset is sorted by the device used, the button pressed to achieve a signal, and the subject word within that signal.
